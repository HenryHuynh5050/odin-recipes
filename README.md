# odin-recipes
This project is a test of what I've learned/reinforced about html in The Odin Project's foundational course. The brief for the project is a basic recipe website that will have an index main page that links to a few recipes. By the end of this project I will have demonstrated all of the foundational basics of html.

## Self Reflection
Not necessary but, I might as well. I managed to meet the assignment's steps within 2 hours. It's not a reasonable flex as the website only meets the bare minimum.

I spot two major issues. The images link off site which means that in the future they may not be available anymore. This is trivial but, you can't go back to the main page within the other pages.

Overall, I actually think this was a success. I think I'm starting to get a hang of html. That's most likely because, I started going through this a week ago (as of 10/28/2023).
